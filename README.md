The code contains two classes, "Student" and "StudentsReport" for a student reporting system.
The "Student" class contains information about a student's name and marks in various subjects.
The "StudentsReport" class contains a list of all students, and it provides functions for adding students, adding marks for each student, calculating the class and subject average, and getting the top 2 consistent students.
In the "main" method of the "StudentReport" class, the program takes input from the user to add students and their marks.
and then it calculates the class and subject average and prints the names of the top 2 consistent students.
